  enlightenment, working closely with a governmental authority figure,
  collaborating with Hollywood personalities, machinations on his creative ideas
  there within, a false bride, to saving a damsel in distress--the list goes on.

  create and say. Though it is early in the brighter days of his musical career,
  a promising and flourishing future is in store for this courageous man. “He
  Who Hath An Ear, Hear”.
